## About
The Patient Care Report inspired me to create an app for students who want to persue a career in EMS as a EMT and anyone willing to learn new things. 

The patient Care report can be written on paper or in an electronic device. Using an electronic device is easier and it stores all patients data. In Vitals EMS, vitals are an important area in a electronic patient care report (EPCR).

## Vitals in EMS

Vitals are taken for all patients, before arriving to the hospital, EMT's go through a stel called the primary assessment where Vitals are taken. During this step, this is how EMT's know if they have to hurry up and transport the patient.
